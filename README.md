# Distributed Databases - Mini Project

## Simulating a distributed database environment. The environment should:

### 1. Be Heterogeneous with at least 3 different participating DBMSs and have at least 3 physical sites.

### 2. Demonstrate the use of PHF, DHF and VF. Fragments of the global relations must exist in separate physical sites. 
### 3. Have a central site to perform reconstruction of the fragments to their global relations and therefore allow execution of read queries on global relations.
